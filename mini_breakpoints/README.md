# Responsive Design Project L5

##Diclaimer: 
This is an intermediate submission for Udacity's Full-Stack Web-Developer Nano Degree. 

##Updates: 
Modified code to: 

1. Limit the characters per line appropriately 
2. Make the sports table responsive using 'No More Tables' and move it to the bottom for small screens. Probably not the most elegant way of doing it, but I thought I'd practice the method. 

Might add the follwoing in the near future: 
* More Minor Breakpoints for Fonts
* Responsive images
